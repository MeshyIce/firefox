Pocket Guide: Shipping Firefox
==============================

*Estimated read time:* 15min


Introduction
------------

The purpose of this document is to provide a high level understanding of
how Mozilla ships Firefox. With the intention of helping new Mozillians
(and those who would like a refresher) understand the basics of our
release process, tools, common terms, and mechanisms employed in
shipping Firefox to our users. Often this document will introduce a
concept, explain how it fits into the process, and then provide a link
to learn more if interested.

Repositories & Channels
-----------------------

Shipping Firefox follows a software release :ref:`train model <train model>`
along 3 primary code :ref:`repositories <repositories>`; mozilla-central
(aka “m-c”), mozilla-beta, and mozilla-release. Each of these repositories are
updated within a defined cadence and built into one of our Firefox
products which are released through what is commonly referred to as
:ref:`Channels <channels>`: Firefox Nightly, Firefox Beta, and Firefox Release.

`Firefox Nightly <https://whattrainisitnow.com/release/?version=nightly>`__ offers access
to the latest feature work still under active development. Released every 12 hours with all
the changes that have :ref:`landed <landing>` on mozilla-central for Desktop and Android.

Every `4 weeks <https://whattrainisitnow.com/calendar/>`__, we :ref:`merge <merge>` the code
for Desktop and Android builds from mozilla-central to our mozilla-beta branch. New code or
features can be added to mozilla-beta outside of this 4 week cadence but are required to land
on mozilla-central before being :ref:`uplifted <uplift>` to mozilla-beta.

`Firefox Beta <https://whattrainisitnow.com/release/?version=beta>`__ is for developers and early
adopters who want to see and test what’s coming next in Firefox. We ship new Desktop and Android
Beta builds three times a week.

.. note::

  The first and second beta builds of a new cycle are shipped to a
  subset of our Beta population. The full Beta population gets updated
  starting with Beta 3 only.

.. note::

  **Firefox Developer Edition** is a separate Desktop-only product based on
  the mozilla-beta branch and is specifically tailored for Web Developers.

`Firefox Release <https://whattrainisitnow.com/release/?version=release>`__ is updated every 4 weeks
when a given version reaches the end of its Beta cycle. This is the primary product we ship to end users.
While a release is live, interim updates (dot releases) are used to ship important bug fixes prior to
the next major release. These can happen on an as-needed basis when there is an important-enough
:ref:`driver <dot release drivers>` to do so (such as a critical bug severely impairing the usability
of the product for some users). In order to provide better predictability, there is also a planned
dot release scheduled for two weeks after the initial go-live for less-critical fixes and other
:ref:`ride-along fixes <ride alongs>` deemed low-risk enough to include.

.. note::
  `Firefox ESR (Extended Support Release) <https://whattrainisitnow.com/release/?version=esr>`__ is
  a separate product intended for enterprise use. Major updates are rolled out once per year to maintain
  stability and predictability. ESR also contains a number of enterprise policy options not available on
  the standard Firefox Release channel. Minor updates are shipped in sync with the Firefox Release
  schedule and generally only contain security and select quality fixes.

Landing Code and Shipping Features
----------------------------------

Mozillians (those employed by MoCo and the broader community) land lots of code in
the Mozilla repositories: fixes, enhancements, compatibility, new features, etc. which are
managed by git. All code development is tracked in
:ref:`Bugzilla <bugzilla>`, reviewed in :ref:`Phabricator <Phabricator>`, and then checked
into the mozilla-central repository using :ref:`Lando <Lando>`.

.. note::

  Some teams use :ref:`GitHub <github>` during development but will still be required to use
  Phabricator (tracked in Bugzilla) to check their code into the mozilla-central hg repository.

The standard process for code to be delivered to our users is by ‘riding the trains’, meaning that
it’s landed in mozilla-central to ship in Nightly builds while it waits for the next Beta cycle to
begin. After merging to Beta, the code stabilizes over a 4 week period (along with everything else
that merged from mozilla-central from that development cycle). At the end of the Beta cycle, a
release candidate (:ref:`RC <rc>`) build is generated, tested thoroughly, and eventually is released
as the next major version of Firefox.

-  `Firefox Release Notes Nomination <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Release_Management/Release_Notes_Nomination>`__

An exception to this process...
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Not all code can simply wait for the normal train model to be included in a Firefox build.
There are a variety of reasons for this; critical fixes, security concerns, stabilizing a feature
that’s already in Beta, shipping high-priority features/enhancements faster, and so on.

In these situations, an uplift can be requested to take a recent landing in mozilla-central and
merge specific bits to the Beta or Release repository outside the standard train model. After the
request is made, :ref:`Release Management <release management>` will assess the potential risk and
make a decision on whether it will be accepted or not.

While uplifts are generally not the preferred way to ship new feature work, it is understood that there
are times when business needs to do so justify the required effort. Our release process is designed to
have the flexibility to accommodate these requests, though in general they need to be handled on a case
by case basis to determine the suitability. Teams are encouraged to reach out to Release Management in
the `#release-coordination` channel on Slack or `@relman` so their specific needs can be assessed.

Factors that will need to be taken into account include:

-  Size and scope of patches to be uplifted
-  QA availability to test prior to shipping and during development
-  Engineering resources to resolve any conflicts between different development branches
-  String additions/changes which may impact available locales

Ensuring build stability
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Throughout the process of landing code in mozilla-central to riding the trains to Firefox Release,
there are many milestones and quality checkpoints from a variety of teams. This process is designed
to ensure a quality and compelling product will be consistently delivered to our users with each new
version. See below for a detailed list of those milestones.

===================================================== ================ ================= =======================================================================================


The Release Management team (aka “Relman”) monitors and enforces this process to protect the
stability of Firefox. Each member of Relman rotates through end-to-end ownership of a given
:ref:`release cycle <release cycle>`. The Relman owner of a cycle will focus on the overall release,
blocker bugs, risks, backout rates, stability/crash reports, etc. Go here for a complete overview of
the `Relman Release Process Checklist <https://wiki.mozilla.org/Release_Management/Release_Process_Checklist_Documentation>`__.

.. note::

  While Relman continually monitors the overall health of each release, it is the responsibility
  of the engineering organization to ensure that the code they are landing is of high quality and the
  potential risks are understood. Every release has an assigned :ref:`Regression Engineering
  Owner <reo>` (REO) to ensure a decision is made about each regression reported in the release.

Enabling/Disabling code (Prefs)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Within Firefox we allow the ability to enable/disable bits of code or entire features using
:ref:`Preferences <preferences>`. There are many reasons why this is useful. For example:

-  Continual development over multiple release cycles without exposing partially-completed
   features to our users
-  Provide the ability to quickly disable a feature if there is a problem found during the
   release process
-  Control features which are experimental or not ready to be shown to a specific channel
   population (e.g. enabled for Beta but disabled for Release)
-  A/B testing via :ref:`telemetry <telemetry>` experiments

.. note::

  :ref:`Nimbus <nimbus>` Pref Rollout is a feature that allows Mozilla to change the state of a
  preference for a targeted set of users, without deploying an update to Firefox. This is
  especially useful when conducting experiments or a gradual rollout of high risk features
  to our Release population.

Release & Feature QA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Desktop Test Engineering team is responsible for testing all critical browser areas,
core and new. Organized in two-week sprints its primary goals are:


-  qualifying builds for release,
-  new feature testing based on Jira request,
-  smoke, functional, exploratory and other recurring testing activities conducted each release cycle,
-  bug work (such as bug fix verification and investigation),
-  various process improvement initiatives,
-  and community engagement.


Features that can have significant impact and/or pose risk to the code base should be
nominated for QA support by the :ref:`feature owner <feature owner>` in its intended
release by submitting a new request in Jira. This process is kicked off by filing a new
Jira ticket `here <https://mozilla-hub.atlassian.net/jira/software/c/projects/QA/boards/261>`__
(detailed steps in `How to file a QA
request <https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oz1YyaaBI-oHUDsktWA-dLtX7WzhYqs7C121yOPKo2w/edit?usp=sharing>`__).
These are due by the end of week 4 of the previous Nightly cycle in which the feature needs testing.

Experiments
~~~~~~~~~~~

As we deliver new features to our users, we continually ask ourselves about the potential impacts,
both positive and negative. For many new features, we will run an experiment to gather data around
these impacts. A simple definition of an experiment is a way to measure how a change to our product
affects how people use it.

An experiment has three parts:

1. A new feature that can be selectively enabled
2. A group of users to test the new feature
3. Telemetry to measure how people interact with the new feature

Experiments are managed by an in-house tool called `Experimenter <https://experimenter.services.mozilla.com/>`__.
